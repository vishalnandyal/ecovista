The following repository consists all the resources and code of the project ECOVISTA. This project is done by me, Vasudeva, Sharath &amp; Uday.
Brief overview of the project: We aimed to revolutionize waste management by utilizing computer vision, deploying advanced algorithms and frameworks to create a sophisticated waste segregation system. This system facilitates litter detection and enhances surveillance capabilities. Additionally, we innovated the prototype design by integrating IoT principles and continual learning mechanisms. Smart sensors and actuators enable real-time monitoring and optimization of waste collection routes. Through extensive exploration of these applications, we pushed the boundaries of innovation, paving the way for future advancements in waste management.
