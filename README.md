## 🔥 Overview

This project aims to address environmental challenges by automating **waste segregation** and **litter detection** using cutting-edge computer vision techniques and deep learning models like **YOLO (You Only Look Once)**. The system classifies waste into categories (e.g., HAZARDOUS, NON-HAZARDOUS, RECYCLE, ORGANIC) and detects litter in real-world environments, paving the way for smarter waste management solutions.

**Key Features**:  
- **Real-time Detection:** Identifies and categorizes waste with high precision.  
- **Environmental Impact:** Encourages effective waste management and promotes cleanliness.  
- **Scalable Design:** Works across varied environments like homes, public spaces, or industrial sites.
